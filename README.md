# Daisy.Patch_sm
Patch and utilities for Daisy Patch submodule and in particular for Patch.init() eurorack module.

I plan to store all my files here for you to reuse. Just create an empty project with same name as the file here on GIthub with VScode. Drop the file in the VScode directory,  compile and flash  the Paztch.init().

* Waveshaper : read the Cpp file for more information.
